- **Features**:
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Height
  - Weight
  - Heart Rate
  - Exercise Duration
  - Body Temperature
    
## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed comprehensive EDA to better understand the dataset:
- **Univariate analysis** to explore individual feature distributions
- **Bivariate analysis** to study relationships between variables
- **Correlation heatmap** to visualize feature correlations
- **Outlier detection** using Isolation Forest algorithm

## 🛠️ Model Building
- Preprocessed data and handled outliers
- Trained multiple regression models
- Selected the best-performing model based on R² score
- Achieved a **high R² value of 0.999**, indicating excellent model performance

## 🚀 Application
